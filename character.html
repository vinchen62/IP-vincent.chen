                        <p>Kratos is the main protagonist of the God of War series. Born in Sparta, Kratos was a respected soldier and General, 
                        up until he lost his wife and daughter when he killed them albeit by accident under Ares' command, earning him his nickname The Ghost of Sparta,
                        after which he renounced his service to the war god, eventually killing him and later on ascending to Godhood before exacting revenge against his father,
                        the Olympians and the Titans who betrayed him. 
                        </p>
                        <p>After successfully exacting his vengeance, Kratos escaped into the world of Norse gods by settling down in Midgard in Ancient Norway where he married another 
                        woman named Faye and bore a son named Atreus, together after the boy's mother's death would embark on a journey to spread her ashes at the highest peak of all nine realms</p>

                        <p>Ares was the original Olympian God of War and the main antagonist of the God of War game and perpetrator behind the events of God of War: Ascension, 
                        he was also responsible for setting the events of the series into motion by trapping, manipulating Kratos into slaying his family and indirectly responsible 
                        for his metamorphosis into the Ghost of Sparta and setting him on the path which would eventually lead to the destruction of Olympus at his hands. He was the 
                        son of Zeus and Hera. Ares was the oldest child of Zeus and was commonly referred as the most hated god on Mount Olympus, even before being killed by Kratos.

                        <p>Athena was the Olympian Goddess of Wisdom and War, and the Deuteragonist of the God of War Series, who mostly appeared as an ally of Kratos.
                        </p>
                        <p>She was seen as a neutral character in God of War II, and her place as Deuteragonist was taken by Orkos in God of War: Ascension ,by Gaia in God of War II 
                        and by Atreus in God of War (2018). In the middle stages of God of War III, after Gaia betrayed Kratos, Athena took her place back as the Deuteragonist and helped 
                        Kratos in ways that she could. She had a cameo appearance as an illusion in God of War (2018), where she goads Kratos about his past.</p>
