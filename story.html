                <p> 
                    Kratos the captain of the spartain army was facing death in the battle with the barbains.
                    Before he was struck down, he calls out to the god of war Ares to save his men and to give 
                    him the power to destroy his enemies. In return Kratos will serve under Ares and become the
                    the ultimate warrior. Ares agrees and bestowes upon Kratos the blades of chaos and Kratos beheads the king
                    of the barbarians.
                 </p>  
                <p>
                    Kratos then wages war against Ares enemies. During Kratos' rampage he attacks a village of whorshippers of Athena. Unbeknownst to Kratos Ares had seceretly transported Kratos's wife 
                    and child to that village. During his frenzy through the temple Kratos accidently kills his own wife and child. Ares thinking this would relieve Kratos of all earthly ties and he would become
                    the perfect Warror. The spartain instead renounced his pledge to the God of War. The Oracle of the destoryed village than cursed Kratos with all the sin he had committed by bonding the ashes of 
                    his murdered family to his skin, turning him pale white. This earned him the name "Ghost of Sparta".
                </p> 
                <p>
                    Kratos plagued with nightmares of the his deeds, vowed service to other gods in hopes that they would rid him of these nightmares
                    Kratos after 10 years of servitude of the Gods grew tired of all the service and suffering. He called Athena for a resolution and with it
                    Athena gives Kratos a final task. If he were to kill the God of war Ares, Kratos will be forgiven for the murder of his family. The gods were at war with each 
                    other and since Zeus the king of the gods forbid divine intervention Athena could only rely on Kratos to stop Ares.
                    Athena guides Kratos through the "Desert of Lost Souls" and tells Kratos the only way to kill a God is to use the power of pandoras box.
                    Pandora's box was located in the templed chained to the back of the titan Cronos. Kratos summons cronos and climbs to the temple. Kratos battles through the temple traps and monsters
                    and finds the box. But before he was able to open the box and gain its power. Ares with a godly feat hurls a boken pillar across the earth impaling Kratos and killing him.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ares takes pandoras box, and Kratos falls into the pits of Hell. Kratos with sheer rage and will fights his way through the pits of hell, and with the help of a mysterious gravedigger escapes
                    Hell. Kratos recovers pandoras box, opens it and obtains godlike powers. During the battle Ares batters Kratos physically and mentally. Ares also strips Kratos of his blades of chaos and all his magic that he
                    had aquired through his battles. But dispite all that Kratos prevails and kills Ares with the Blade of the Gods. Kratos beaten and tired has finally finished his last service. As promised Athena forgives Kratos of his sins, but 
                    the gods cannot erase his nightmares. Forsaken by the gods, Kratos tries to commit suicide by jumping off a cliff into the Aegean Sea. Athena however intervenes and sends Kratos to Mount Olympus. As a reward for his service of the gods
                    and with the new vacancy of a god, Kratos is bestowed new blades and was given the positon as the new God of War.

                <h3> God of War 2</h3>
                <p>
                    Kratos, the new God of War, is still haunted by nightmares of his past and is shunned by the other gods for his destructive ways. Ignoring Athena's warnings, Kratos joins the Spartan army in an attack on Rhodes, during which a giant eagle suddenly drains him of his powers and animates the Colossus of Rhodes. 
                    While battling the statue, Zeus offers Kratos the Blade of Olympus in order to defeat it, requiring Kratos to infuse the blade with the remainder of his godly power. Although now human, Kratos defeats the Colossus but is mortally wounded. The eagle reveals itself to have been Zeus all along, who states he was
                    forced to intervene as Athena refused to do so. Zeus then grants Kratos a final opportunity to be loyal to the gods, but Kratos refuses. Zeus kills him with the blade and destroys the Spartan army.

                    Kratos is slowly dragged to the Underworld, but is saved by the Titan Gaia. Gaia tells Kratos that she once raised the young Zeus, who eventually betrayed the Titans as vengeance for the cruelty inflicted on his siblings by Zeus' father, Cronos. She instructs Kratos to find the "Sisters of Fate", who can alter time, 
                    prevent his death, and allow him his revenge on Zeus. With the aid of Pegasus, Kratos finds the lair of Gaia's brother Typhon. Imprisoned under a mountain, Typhon is angered at the intrusion and traps Pegasus, forcing Kratos to explore on foot. Kratos encounters the Titan Prometheus, who is chained in mortal form and tortured at Zeus' 
                    directive for giving fire to mankind. Prometheus begs to be released from his torment, so Kratos confronts Typhon to steal his magical bow. He blinds the massive Titan with it to escape and then uses it to free Prometheus, who falls into a fire and dies, finally free of eternal torture. The Immolation releases the power of the Titans which Kratos absorbs, 
                    using it to free Pegasus and then fly to the Island of Creation.

                <p>
                    Just before reaching the island, Kratos fights and kills Theseus to awaken the gigantic stone Steeds of Time a gift to the Sisters of Fate from Cronos in an attempt to change his own fateâ€”which grants Kratos access to the island. There, Kratos encounters and defeats several foes, some of whom-themselves are also seeking the Sisters of Fate, 
                    including an undead version of his old foe the Barbarian King, the Gorgon Euryale, Perseus, and Icarus. He eventually encounters the imprisoned Titan Atlas, who initially resents Kratos for his current predicament. After Kratos explains his intent, Atlas reveals that Gaia and the other Titans also seek revenge on Zeus for their defeat in the Great War.
                    Atlas also reveals that the Blade of Olympus is the key to defeating Zeus and helps Kratos to reach the "Palace of the Fates".

                    After evading traps and defeating more enemies, including the Kraken, Kratos encounters an unseen foe, revealed to be a loyal Spartan soldier also in search of the Sisters. Before he dies, the soldier informs Kratos that Zeus has destroyed Sparta in Kratos' absence. Outraged, Kratos is further motivated and frees a phoenix, 
                    riding the creature to the Sisters' stronghold where he confronts two, Lakhesis and Atropos. After they refuse his request to alter time, Kratos battles them. During this, the Sisters try to change the outcome of Kratos' battle with Ares, but Kratos kills them both, then confronts the remaining Sister, Clotho. He kills her using her own traps, 
                    and acquires the "Loom of Fate" in order to return to the point at which Zeus betrayed him.

                    Kratos surprises Zeus, seizes the Blade of Olympus, and finally incapacitates him. Athena intervenes and implores Kratos to stop, as by killing Zeus, he will destroy Olympus. Kratos ignores her and tries to kill Zeus, but Athena sacrifices herself by impaling herself upon the blade, granting Zeus' escape. Before she dies, 
                    Athena reveals that Kratos is actually Zeus' son. Zeus was afraid Kratos would usurp him, just as Zeus had usurped his own father, Cronos. Kratos declares that the rule of the gods is at an end, then travels back in time and rescues the Titans just before their defeat in the Great War. He returns with the Titans to the present, 
                    and the gods watch as their former foes climb Mount Olympus. Kratos, standing on the back of Gaia, declares that he has brought the destruction of Olympus, setting up the events of God of War III.

                <h3> God of War 3</h3>
                <p> Continuing immediately after God of War II, Kratos, Gaia, and the other Titans ascend Mount Olympus to destroy the Olympian gods. Poseidon launches an assault against the Titans, but is killed by Kratos and Gaia; his death causes the oceans to flood Greece. Reaching the peak of Olympus, they try to attack Zeus, but he drives them back and knocks them off the mountain. 
                    Gaia clings to the mountainside and refuses to save Kratos, calling him nothing more than a pawn for the Titans' revenge.

                    Kratos falls into the River Styx, where he loses the Blade of Olympus; the souls of the Underworld weaken him and ruin the Blades of Athena. Climbing from the river, he is confronted by Athena's spirit, who had previously sacrificed herself to save Zeus from Kratos. She tells Kratos that her sacrifice has brought her to a higher existence, and she now sees truths she did not see before. 
                    She states that as long as Zeus reigns, there is no hope for mankind. She gives him the Blades of Exile and says that he must extinguish the Flame of Olympus to kill Zeus. After finding the three Judges of the Underworld and the Chain of Balance, Kratos encounters the spirit of Pandora, whom he mistakes for his dead daughter, Calliope. Refusing to help the child, he continues his quest. 
                    After encountering the Olympian blacksmith Hephaestus and recovering the Blade of Olympus, he kills Hades and releases the souls of the Underworld. He considers searching for Calliope's soul, but Athena reminds Kratos of his quest, and he leaves the Underworld, arriving at Olympia, where he finds the wounded Gaia, who calls for help. He severs her arm, causing her to fall from Mount Olympus 
                    to her apparent death.

                <p>
                    Kratos continues his ascent, murdering powerful foes that include the Titan Perses and the god Helios; Helios' death plunges Greece into eternal darkness. This leads to an encounter with Hermes, who mocks Kratos for his past sins. Kratos chases Hermes and arrives at the Chamber of the Flame. Kratos discovers that Pandora's Box is in the Flame of Olympus and is key to the success of his quest, as it was in God of War. 
                    Athena appears, telling Kratos that the flames around the box can only be quelled by Pandora. Kratos then continues after the overconfident Hermes, whom he catches and kills, releasing a plague on Greece. At the Forum, he has an audience with the drunken Hera, who ignores his request for Pandora's location and summons Hercules. After discussing his jealousy of his half-brother, Hercules attacks Kratos, but is killed. 
                    Kratos then encounters Aphrodite, who is indifferent to his war on Olympus. She leads him to her estranged husband Hephaestus through Hyperion's Gate, a teleportation device. In a suicide mission, the blacksmith sends Kratos to Tartarus to retrieve the Omphalos Stone so he can forge a new weapon for the Spartan. Kratos finds Cronos, kills the Titan for the stone, and returns to Hephaestus. After forging the weapon, the
                    god tries to kill Kratos himself. Instead, the Spartan kills Hephaestus, who claims that he was trying to protect his daughter Pandora, who was imprisoned in the Labyrinth after Kratos opened her box. Reusing the Hyperion Gate, Kratos travels through Hera's Gardens where he kills Hera, ending all Greek plant life, and makes his way to the Labyrinth to find Pandora.

                    The imprisoned architect Daedalus tells Kratos to unite the Labyrinth. Completing this task, Kratos fights his way through the aerial puzzle and rescues Pandora, who tells him to break the Chain of Balance so the Labyrinth can be raised, and she can reach her box. Neutralizing the three judges and breaking the chain, Kratos raises the Labyrinth, and Pandora tries to enter the Flame of Olympus. Zeus intervenes and fights Kratos; 
                    after a brief battle, Pandora sacrifices herself and quenches the flame, despite Kratos' protests. Finding Pandora's Box empty, Kratos attacks Zeus. Gaia returns and tries to kill them, but they escape through her gaping chest wound and continue their battle. Gaia is killed when Kratos impales Zeus against her heart with the Blade of Olympus, which apparently also kills Zeus. When Kratos recovers the blade and tries to leave, 
                    he is attacked by Zeus' spirit and loses all of his weapons in the process. Before Zeus can land a fatal blow, Kratos is saved by Pandora during a journey into his psyche. With help from the spirits of his wife Lysandra and his daughter Calliope, Kratos forgives himself for his past sins. After discovering hope, he regains consciousness and beats Zeus to death with his bare hands, ending the reign of the Olympian Gods.

                <p>
                   Athena reappears, demanding that Kratos return what she thinks he took from Pandora's Box. She refuses to believe the box was empty, explaining that when Zeus sealed the evils of the world in the box, she placed hope in it, foreseeing that it would eventually be opened. Athena realizes that when Kratos opened the box to defeat Ares, the evils escaped and infected the gods while Kratos was imbued with hope, which enabled him to kill Ares. 
                   She tells Kratos to return her power, saying that she knows how to use it to rebuild what had been destroyed. Distrusting Athena and tired of being used as a pawn, Kratos refuses; saying his vengeance has ended, he impales himself with the Blade of Olympus and releases hope to heal all he had destroyed. An angry Athena pulls the sword from him, saying that he has disappointed her and leaves empty-handed. Near death, Kratos collapses as Athena leaves. 
                   <br><br>
                   In a post-credits scene, a trail of blood leads away from an abandoned Blade of Olympus, with Kratos' whereabouts unknown.
